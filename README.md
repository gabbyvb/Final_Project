# Home Price Predictor

## Background
### Project Description
**Topic:** Home Price Predictor

**Reason:** Real estate is a hot market right now and all group members were interested in seeing how various factors affect the value of a home in our area.

**Questions We Hope to Answer**
1. Does the rating of schools affect the home value? If so, how?
2. How does Prime Rate affect home value?
3. Are homes in the area being under- or over-valued?
